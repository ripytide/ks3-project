## School Setup Instructions

1. Install Python on the students' lab machines (version 3.x). https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. This should include the IDLE IDE if the machines don't already have an editor like VSCode.
3. Install Pygame for the chosen version of Python. `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`
4. Clone this repository (https://github.com/PaoloMura/ks3-project) into a shared folder that the students have access to.

To test that setup was successful, please check that students are able to:
1. Copy the ks3-project folder into their own personal directory.
2. Open the example.py file with an IDE (e.g. IDLE).
3. Run the code (a window should appear with the Japanese flag).
