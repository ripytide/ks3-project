# KS3 Project

This repository contains resources designed for coding clubs at secondary schools in Bristol.
There are two sets of resources: Sketch and Pygame.
Each one includes a set of six worksheets for students to follow during the term.

The Sketch resource provides a Python module called `sketch.py`.
This is a wrapper for Pygame that exposes a very small set of functionality.
With it, students can draw shapes onto a window using a simple interface.
Each worksheet takes the student through creating an image using these commands.

The Pygame resource teaches the fundamentals of Python programming and the Pygame syntax.
By the end of the worksheets, students should have enough knowledge to create their own games with Pygame.
Unlike Sketch, each worksheet teaches some new concepts while asking the student to modify some given starter code.
